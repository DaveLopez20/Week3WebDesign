<p><b>It is a story about a man named Columbus who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, and then he meets a man named Tallahassee since he is looking for some Twinkies. They would later meet two survivors called Wichita and Little Rock and soon realize they would need each other to survive the apocalypse.
